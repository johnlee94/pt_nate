# Let's Pretend we are a Bank...

1. Create an account variable "myAccount", with three properties: name, expenses, and income.
Provide values of your name, and initialize the expenses/income properties to 0.

2. Create a function addExpense that takes in 2 arguments, an account object and an expense (number) value that increments
the object's expenses property value with the passed in expense value.

3. Create a function addIncome that takes in 2 arguments, an account object and an income (number) value that increments
the object's income property value with the passed in income value.

4. Create a function resetAccount that takes in 1 argument, an account object, and resets the expenses and income property values
to 0.

5. Create a function getAccountSummary that takes in 1 argument, an account object, and returns a string sentence including the
account's owner, current balance, current income, and current expenses.

i.e.
```
Output: "Account for John has $500. $1000 in income. $500 in expenses."
```

### Test your Code

6. Add $1000 to your myAccount's income. Add $250 to your myAccount's expenses.

7. Console log your myAccount and check to see if the properties were properly updated.

8. Reset your account using the resetAccount function. Console log myAccount to check if the account was reset.

9. Add $100,000 to your income (Wow you did you win the lotto?). Choose a car you would like to buy and google the car's price.
Now buy it! (Add to your expenses)

10. Finally console.log your getAccountSummary function, with your myAccount variable passed in as the parameter to get a balance
and summary of your account.

Great! You are now ready to start your banking business.
