# A Brief Overview of Javascript!!

Javascript is an object-oriented programming language primarily used in programming
in the world wide web.

It is commonly used as a scripting language for websites.

This means that Javascript handles *functionality*.

In your browser, open up developer console and paste this javascript code into your console...

```
alert('Hello World!')
```

What just happened?

In 1995, Brendan Eich created the Javascript language for the sole purpose of handling
web scripting... He created it in just 10 days!

Today, Javascript has evolved over the years, and though it is still primarily used to
handle Web Development, it has been used to do some cool things such as even programming a droid!


The very basics of web development utilizes HTML/CSS/Javascript to create web pages.

*HTML* is another language used to create elements on a page, and looks something like this...

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

HTML files are denoted by the .html file extension (i.e. index.html)


*CSS* is another language used to style these elements, and is denoted by the .css
file extension (i.e. style.css)

*Javascript* is the language we will be primarily working with that handles the functionality
of web pages. Javascript files look something like: scripts.js

They are denoted by the .js file extension type.

In the future, we will create a game like this using HTML/CSS/Javascript as our first
milestone project! :)))
