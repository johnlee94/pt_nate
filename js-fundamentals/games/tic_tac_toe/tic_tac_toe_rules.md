# TIC TAC TOE BABY

It's time to use everything we've learned about in Javascript to build a simple
Tic-Tac-Toe game.

In other words, it's time for you to ShoW Me WhaT you GOT!!

I assume you already know how to play a tic-tac-toe game...

But here are the requirments for our game:
<ul>
<li>2 players should be able to play the game (From same computer)</li>
<li>The Board should be printed out every time a player makes a move</li>
<li>You should be able to accept a player input by number position and then place the symbol on the board</li>
<ul>
