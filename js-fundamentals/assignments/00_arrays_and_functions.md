# Arrays in Functions!

1. Define a function isCharAVowel that takes a character as an argument and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

2. Define a function sumArray that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers. For example, sumArray([2, 4, 5]); would return 11.

3. Define a function multiplyArray that takes an array of numbers and returns the product those numbers. For example, multiplyArray([2, 4, 5]); would return 40.

4. Define a function longestWordLength that takes an array of strings (words) and returns the length of the longest word.

5. Define a function stringsLongerThan that takes an array of strings and a number as arguments; and returns an array of the strings that are longer than the number passed in. For example, stringsLongerThan(['touch', 'me', 'in', 'the', 'morning'], 2); would return ["touch", "the", "morning"].
